/* In the question 2 
if we take the input to be 
1 3
7 7
1 2 
2 3
2 4
3 5
3 6
4 7
now in this input we have taken the source vertex to be equals to 1 and we have to find the distance between source vertex and the node 3, so it will compute the set of undirected data given as input and calculate the distance vector accordingly which in this case is equal to 2


now in question 4 
By using BFS, it is shown whether the graph contains any cycle or not 
I have used the logic that the parent vertex can have more than one children but the nodes (children ) can have only one parent node
now if in any case if the children node has more than one parent then the graph must be a cycle
